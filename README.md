## 🚀 Current MVP Features

The dashboard provides a quick and insightful overview of your progress on CSES:

1. **Successfully Solved:** Total count of problems with accepted solutions.
2. **Attempted (Failed):** Problems that were tried but not yet solved.
3. **Total Problems:** Total number of available problems in the CSES Problemset.
4. **🔐 Automatic Login:**

   * Stores your username and password securely in Chrome’s **local storage**.
   * Automatically logs you in whenever CSES logs you out (since its cookies expire quickly).
5. **🌓 Dark/Light Mode Selection:**

   * Choose your preferred theme directly from the dashboard.
   * Your preference is remembered automatically.

* **Progress Heatmap:** Visualize your solving activity over time.
* **Improved UI/UX:** A modern, elegant interface with smooth animations.
* **Local Caching:** Store problem data and statistics for faster loading and offline access.
* **Custom Problem Lists:** Create personalized lists such as:
