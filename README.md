# CSES Problemset Dashboard

A custom dashboard for tracking and visualizing progress on the [CSES Problemset](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

---

## ðŸš€ Current MVP Features

The initial version of the dashboard provides core metrics to quickly assess progress:

1.  **Successfully Solved:** The total count of problems/tasks that have a correct and accepted solution.
2.  **Attempted (Failed):** The number of problems/tasks that have been attempted but not yet successfully solved.
3.  **Total Problems:** The total number of problems available in the CSES Problemset.

## âœ¨ Future Plans & Enhancements

I am planning a dedicated, full-page dashboard with the following features:

* **Progress Heatmap:** A visual representation (e.g., a calendar or grid) to show solving activity over time.
* **Improved UI/UX:** A modern, beautiful, and intuitive user interface.
* **Local Caching:** Storing problem data and user statistics locally for faster load times and offline viewing.
* **Custom Problem Lists:** Functionality to create and manage various lists, such as **Favorites**, **Revisit** for challenging problems, **To-Do** lists, and more.
